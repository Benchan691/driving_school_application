I got so disappointed and a friend of mine told me about Alex. We had only two lessons (introductory and mock road test) - and I passed! Alex is super honest, intelligent and informative - he even showed road test routes for level 5 (even though I was looking for 7), he said better safe than sorry and I need to know those routes too just in case. And you know what? I got the difficult one! Thanks to Alex who went beyond and showed more!!! If you ever think of a a road test in Vancouver - your only way is to call Alex!!! All my best wishes to Alex and his family! Thank you so much!!!",

He’s one of the most patient and easygoing instructors I’ve ever met. We actually ended up at the wrong road test location on test day (long story!), but Alex stayed calm, and thankfully the staff let me take the test anyway. Everything worked out in the end. I highly recommend this school and especially Alex if you want a smooth and supportive learning experience.",
